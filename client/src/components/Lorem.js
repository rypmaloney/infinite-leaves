                of the wind, <br></br> A few light kisses, a few embraces, a
                reaching around of arms, <br></br>The play of shine and shade on
                the trees as the supple boughs wag,<br></br> The delight alone
                or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and
                hill-sides, <br></br>The feeling of health, the full-noon trill,
                the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.
