of carrots and parsnips,crossing savannas, trailing in forests,Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,Scorch\u2019d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down theshallow river,Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where thebuck turns furiously at the hunter,Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where theotter is feeding on fish,Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where thebeaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tall;Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower\u2019d cotton plant, overthe rice in its low moist field,Over the sharp-peak\u2019d farm house, with its scallop\u2019d scum andslender shoots from the gutters,Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav\u2019d corn, over thedelicate blue-flower flax,Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there withthe rest,Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by lowscragged limbs,Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the greatgoldbug drops through the dark,Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows tothe meadow,Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulousshuddering of their hides,Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddlethe hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in itmyself and looking composedly down,)Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heathatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,Where the half-burn\u2019d brig is riding on unknown currents,Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;Where the dense-starr\u2019d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game ofbase-ball,At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license,bull-dances, drinking, laughter,At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking thejuice through a straw,At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles,screams, weeps,Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks arescatter\u2019d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud tothe mare, where the cock is treading the hen,Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square milesfar and near,Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-livedswan is curving and winding,Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs hernear-human laugh,Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by thehigh weeds,Where band-neck\u2019d partridges roost in a ring on the ground withtheir heads out,Where burial coaches enter the arch\u2019d gates of a cemetery,Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,Where the yellow-crown\u2019d heron comes to the edge of the marsh atnight and feeds upon small crabs,Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree overthe well,Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,Through the gymnasium, through the curtain\u2019d saloon, through theoffice or public hall;Pleas\u2019d with the native and pleas\u2019d with the foreign, pleas\u2019d withthe new and old,Pleas\u2019d with the homely woman as well as the handsome,Pleas\u2019d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,Pleas\u2019d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash\u2019d church,Pleas\u2019d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher,impress\u2019d seriously at the camp-meeting;Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon,flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn\u2019d up to the clouds,or down a lane or along the beach,My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek\u2019d bush-boy, (behind mehe rides at the drape of the day,)Far from the settlements studying the print of animals\u2019 feet, or themoccasin print,By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,Nigh the coffin\u2019d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side,Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and thediameter of eighty thousand miles,Speeding with tail\u2019d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,I tread day and night such roads."

O it, more than allelse, you delighting!)From the hungry gnaw that eats me night and day,From native moments, from bashful pains, singing them,Seeking something yet unfound though I have diligently sought itmany a long year,Singing the true song of the soul fitful at random,Renascent with grossest Nature or among animals,Of that, of them and what goes with them my poems informing,Of the smell of apples and lemons, of the pairing of birds,Of the wet of woods, of the lapping of waves,Of the mad pushes of waves upon the land, I them chanting,The overture lightly sounding, the strain anticipating,The welcome nearness, the sight of the perfect body,The swimmer swimming naked in the bath, or motionless on his backlying and floating,The female form approaching, I pensive, love-flesh tremulous aching,The divine list for myself or you or for any one making,The face, the limbs, the index from head to foot, and what it arouses,The mystic deliria, the madness amorous, the utter abandonment,(Hark close and still what I now whisper to you,I love you, O you entirely possess me,O that you and I escape from the rest and go utterly off, free and lawless,Two hawks in the air, two fishes swimming in the sea not morelawless than we;)The furious storm through me careering, I passionately trembling.The oath of the inseparableness of two together, of the woman thatloves me and whom I love more than my life, that oath swearing,(O I willingly stake all for you,O let me be lost if it must be so!O you and I! what is it to us what the rest do or think?What is all else to us? only that we enjoy each other and exhausteach other if it must be so;)From the master, the pilot I yield the vessel to,The general commanding me, commanding all, from him permission taking,From time the programme hastening, (I have loiter\u2019d too long as it is,)From sex, from the warp and from the woof,From privacy, from frequent repinings alone,From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near,From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingersthrough my hair and beard,From the long sustain\u2019d kiss upon the mouth or bosom,From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, faintingwith excess,From what the divine husband knows, from the work of fatherhood,From exultation, victory and relief, from the bedfellow\u2019s embrace inthe night,From the act-poems of eyes, hands, hips and bosoms,From the cling of the trembling arm,From the bending curve and the clinch,From side by side the pliant coverlet off-throwing,From the one so unwilling to have me leave, and me just as unwillingto leave,(Yet a moment O tender waiter, and I return,)From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,From the night a moment I emerging flitting out,Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for,And you stalwart loins."

O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell inyour own way of the heart that is under you,O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you arenot happiness,You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting me,Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots, you make methink of death,Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautifulexcept death and love?)O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers,I think it must be for death,For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers,Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same asyou mean,Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my breast!Spring away from the conceal\u2019d heart there!Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!Come I am determin\u2019d to unbare this broad breast of mine, I havelong enough stifled and choked;Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me not,I will say what I have to say by itself,I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter acall only their call,I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and willthrough the States,Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, andare folded inseparably together, you love and death are,Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,For now it is convey\u2019d to me that you are the purports essential,That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and thatthey are mainly for you,That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how long,That you will one day perhaps take control of all,That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long,But you will last very long."

the handle and sets it firmly in the socket;The shadowy processions of the portraits of the past users also,The primal patient mechanics, the architects and engineers,The far-off Assyrian edifice and Mizra edifice,The Roman lictors preceding the consuls,The antique European warrior with his axe in combat,The uplifted arm, the clatter of blows on the helmeted head,The death-howl, the limpsy tumbling body, the rush of friend and foethither,The siege of revolted lieges determin\u2019d for liberty,The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truceand parley,The sack of an old city in its time,The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in thegripe of brigands,Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing,The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,The list of all executive deeds and words just or unjust,The
