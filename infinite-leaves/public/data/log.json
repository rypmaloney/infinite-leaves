The picture would show a curious child holding out a handful of green grass to an adult who is at a loss for words. The adult's befuddled expression would convey their internal confusion while the child's innocent eyes would provide a sense of wonder and amusement. A soft, natural palette would be used to create a dreamy and hazy atmosphere, typical of impressionistic paintings."],"key":"027-028"},"+2":{"_id":"6426e31e0a8ad5bffe57d9bb","book":"BOOK III","poem":"Song of Myself","order":29,"text":"  I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green<br>      stuff woven.<br>","next":"027-030","prev":"027-028","caption":["The photograph showcases a waving flag made of a bright green fabric that seems to signify optimism and hope.
