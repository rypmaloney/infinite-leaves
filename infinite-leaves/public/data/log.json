The image is of a room with an open window facing a garden. The sunlight is shining through the window, casting a warm glow on the room. There are shelves on the walls of the room with various perfume bottles, and the air is filled with the scent of the perfumes. The viewer can almost smell and taste the sweetness of the perfumes, and feel the warmth of the sun on their skin."],"key":"027-005"},"+0":{"_id":"6426e31d0a8ad5bffe57d9a4","book":"BOOK III","poem":"Song of Myself","order":6,"text":"  The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the<br>      distillation, it is odorless,<br>  It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,<br>  I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,<br>  I am mad for it to be in contact with me.<br>","next":"027-007","prev":"027-005","caption":["The picture is captured in a hazy, dreamlike visual style with a man standing alone in a verdant forest. The image conveys his love for the natural surroundings as he strips off his clothes and walks naked towards a riverbank. The atmosphere around him is surreal; it has no distinct scent or flavor, yet it is incredibly intoxicating to him. The image is peaceful, but there is a sense of madness in the man's longing to be in direct contact with the ethereal atmosphere he finds so alluring."],"key":"027-006"},"+1":{"_id":"6426e31e0a8ad5bffe57d9a5","book":"BOOK III","poem":"Song of Myself","order":7,"text":"  The smoke of my own breath,<br>  Echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,<br>  My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing<br>      of blood and air through my lungs,<br>  The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and<br>      dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,<br>","next":"027-008","prev":"027-006","caption":["The photo is in monochrome with high contrast, presenting a collage of close-up shots of small details.
