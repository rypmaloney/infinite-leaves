        "prompt": "A busy street scene filled with people singing joyfully as they work. Each person has their unique expression, posture, and profession. The brightly colored street with pastel hues depicts the energy and rhythm of work, from the carpenter measuring plank to the young wife at work, each lost in their melody. The style of the picture is realistic but with a vibrant palette and a dynamic composition."

Suddenly, a silver armoured commander, followed by rows of robotic foot soldiers, ride in on hovering motorbikes carrying advanced artillery weapons that burst out laser beams, shields up, prepared to annihilate everything."

Behind him is the image of a flag being lifted by the strong winds of change. The man is representative of the nation, and the chaos and revolt behind him signify the never-ending struggle for freedom and liberty."

        "prompt": "Impressionism. A figure stands calmly amidst nature, at ease among the irrational things of the world. They absorb their surroundings, taking in the landscapes of Mexico, Mannahatta, Tennessee, the north, inland, the coasts, or the lakes through their serene and passive demeanor. This person's identity is shaped primarily by their inner poise rather than external factors like occupation or reputation. They are ready for whatever life throws their way, whether it be harsh weather, hunger, ridicule, accidents or rejections."

        "prompt": "The visual style is impressionism. A person standing in front of closed library doors with arms open wide as if pleading to enter. In one hand, they hold a book, which emanates a warm light, highly contrasting with the cold, impersonal building. The book seems to be a product of the person themselves, representing their innermost thoughts and experiences. The surrounding library is dark and shadowy, but the pages of the book glow with a bright energy that seems to reach out to be felt by an unseen force."
